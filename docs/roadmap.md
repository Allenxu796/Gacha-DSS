# Gacha-DSS Roadmap

## Goal
Evolve gacha strategy from a "probability simulation tool" into a "system-level decision platform" that spans simulation, modeling, decisioning, RL evolution, and production-ready presentation.

## Milestones

### M1 Baseline Closed Loop (Completed)
- Simulation engine + rule configuration
- LLN validation + PDF/CDF visualization
- Raw logs + feature factory
- Two-stage ML modeling + utility output

### M2 Trusted Evaluation (In Progress)
- Probability calibration and bucket alignment
- Risk coefficient sensitivity analysis
- Generate readable decision reports

### M3 Reinforcement Learning Evolution
- Gym-like environment wrapper
- Q-learning baseline
- Gradual introduction of policy gradient / actor-critic

### M4 Engineering and Presentation
- Unified CLI and pipelines
- Reproducible experiment records
- Interview-ready project narrative and demo

## Next Steps
- Design rule curves that better match real versions
- Introduce historical data and user profiles
- Close the loop between strategy, resources, and value
